# 14 Days of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

# What's this?

- Very simple project to show how to share business logic between iOS and Android Apps using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- The idea is to keep it simple and stupid so that people can follow and understand the idea behind KMM.
- Check out each commit to see how the project is developed: https://github.com/antranapp/14DaysOfKotlinMultiplatformMobile/commits/master
